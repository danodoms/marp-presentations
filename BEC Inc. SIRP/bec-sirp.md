## Definition of a Security Breach

- **Unauthorized acquisition of data**
- **Compromises security, confidentiality, or integrity**
- **Exclusions: Good faith acquisitions by employees**

<!--
Presenter Notes:
A security breach is defined as the unauthorized acquisition of data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by BEC Inc. However, good faith acquisition of personal information by an employee for business purposes is not considered a breach, provided the information is not misused.
-->

---

## Incident Identification and Reporting

- **User awareness and training**
- **Detection tools**
- **Reporting mechanism: phishing@becinc.com**

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Timely identification and reporting of phishing attempts are crucial. We conduct regular training sessions to help employees recognize phishing emails, and we use detection tools to scan for malicious content. Suspicious emails should be reported to phishing@becinc.com for further analysis.
-->

---

## Incident Classification and Prioritization

- **Severity Levels: High, Medium, Low**
- **Assessment: source, type, impact**
- **Response Allocation: based on severity**

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Phishing incidents are classified and prioritized based on their severity. High-priority incidents target executives or sensitive data, medium-priority incidents have significant potential for harm, and low-priority incidents are less likely to cause significant damage. We allocate response resources accordingly.
-->

---

## Containment and Eradication

- **Immediate actions: disconnect, block IPs**
- **Forensic analysis**
- **Removal: delete malicious emails, scan systems**
- **System restoration: restore from backups**

<!--
Presenter Notes:
Quickly isolating and neutralizing phishing attempts is critical. Immediate actions include disconnecting affected systems and blocking malicious IP addresses. We then perform forensic analysis to gather evidence, remove malicious content from email inboxes, and restore systems from clean backups.
-->

---

## Post-Incident Review and Recovery

- **Recovery: reset passwords, confirm security**
- **Review meeting: document and lessons learned**
- **Preventive measures: security enhancements, audits**

<!--
Presenter Notes:
After addressing a phishing incident, we focus on recovery and review. This includes resetting compromised credentials, confirming system security, conducting a review meeting, and implementing preventive measures. Regular security audits and training sessions help us stay ahead of future threats.
